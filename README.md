## 🎯 Introduction
A brief overview of your project and its purpose. Mention which problem statement are your attempting to solve. Keep it concise and engaging.

Project Overview:

Our project focuses on developing a Generative AI-powered email classification and OCR solution that can accurately extract, interpret context, and categorize emails with high precision. The primary goal is to enhance email management by automating the sorting, prioritization, and contextual understanding of incoming messages.

Problem Statement:

Businesses and individuals often face challenges in managing high volumes of emails, leading to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and increased workload. Traditional email filtering systems rely on keyword-based or rule-based classification, which often lacks adaptability to nuanced contexts.

Solution:

Our AI-driven system integrates natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and deep learning to:

Extract key information from email content and attachments.

Understand the intent and context using advanced language models.

Classify emails into relevant categories automatically.

Prioritize emails based on urgency, sender importance, or predefined criteria.

This solution aims to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and improve decision-making by providing smart, context-aware email management for organizations and professionals.

## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

The idea for this project was inspired by the increasing need for smarter email management in today’s fast-paced digital world. Many organizations struggle with email overload, making it difficult to keep track of important communications and prioritize responses effectively. Manual sorting and rule-based filters often fail to adapt to evolving business needs and unstructured content within emails and attachments. By leveraging AI-driven automation, we aim to redefine email organization and ensure that users can focus on high-priority tasks. 

Managing emails manually can be time-consuming, especially for organizations dealing with a high volume of messages. Existing rule-based filters often fall short when handling unstructured email content, attachments, and context-based prioritization. As businesses grow, the need for a more efficient, AI-driven email classification system becomes critical. Our goal is to build a solution that automates email categorization, understands context, and helps users focus on important tasks without being buried under an overwhelming inbox.
