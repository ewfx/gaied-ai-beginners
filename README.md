## 🎯 Introduction
A brief overview of your project and its purpose. Mention which problem statement are your attempting to solve. Keep it concise and engaging.

Project Overview:

Our project focuses on developing a Generative AI-powered email classification and OCR solution that can accurately extract, interpret context, and categorize emails with high precision. The primary goal is to enhance email management by automating the sorting, prioritization, and contextual understanding of incoming messages.

Problem Statement:

Businesses and individuals often face challenges in managing high volumes of emails, leading to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and increased workload. Traditional email filtering systems rely on keyword-based or rule-based classification, which often lacks adaptability to nuanced contexts.

Solution:

Our AI-driven system integrates natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and deep learning to:

Extract key information from email content and attachments.

Understand the intent and context using advanced language models.

Classify emails into relevant categories automatically.

Prioritize emails based on urgency, sender importance, or predefined criteria.

This solution aims to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and improve decision-making by providing smart, context-aware email management for organizations and professionals.
